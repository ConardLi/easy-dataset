# Product Context: easy-dataset

## User Problem

Users are trying to use the `easy-dataset` application with a local `mineru-api` to process PDF documents. While the API appears to be processing the files successfully, the application does not display the extracted text chunks, preventing users from utilizing the core functionality of the application.

## UX Goals

-   Users should be able to upload a PDF file and see the extracted text chunks in the UI.
-   The integration with the local `mineru-api` should be seamless and reliable.
-   The application should provide clear feedback to the user about the status of the file processing.
