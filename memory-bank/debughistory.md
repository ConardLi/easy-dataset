# Debugging History for MinerU Integration

## Problem

The `easy-dataset` application was not displaying text chunks after a PDF was successfully processed by the local `mineru-api`. Logs from the `mineru-api` showed a 200 OK response, but the `easy-dataset` UI remained empty.

## Investigation

1.  **Initial Analysis:** I reviewed the source code for `easy-dataset` to understand the integration with `mineru`. I started by examining `lib/file/file-process/pdf/mineru-local.js`, `lib/services/tasks/file-processing.js`, and `lib/file/text-splitter.js`.

2.  **Hypothesis 1: Incorrect data handling.** I initially believed that the response from the `mineru-api` was not being handled correctly in `lib/services/tasks/file-processing.js`. I added logging to inspect the `result` object from `processPdf`.

3.  **Hypothesis 2: Incorrect filename.** The logs revealed that the `result` object from `processPdf` was not being used to determine the filename for the text splitter. This led to the text splitter trying to process the original PDF instead of the markdown file generated by `mineru`. I modified `lib/services/tasks/file-processing.js` to use the filename from the `result` object.

4.  **Hypothesis 3: Absolute vs. Relative Path.** After fixing the filename issue, a new error emerged: `文本分割出错: Error: 文件 ... 不存在` (Text splitting error: Error: File ... does not exist). Further logging showed that `mineru-local.js` was returning an absolute path for the processed markdown file, but `text-splitter.js` was expecting a relative path and was incorrectly prepending the project path, resulting in an invalid file path.

## Resolution

The root cause was the incorrect handling of an absolute path in `lib/file/text-splitter.js`.

The fix was to modify `lib/file/text-splitter.js` to check if the provided `fileName` was an absolute path. If it was, it would be used directly. If not, it would be joined with the project path.

```javascript
// lib/file/text-splitter.js
let filePath = fileName;
if (!path.isAbsolute(filePath)) {
  filePath = path.join(projectPath, 'files', fileName);
}
```

This change ensured that the correct file path was used, resolving the "File does not exist" error and allowing the text chunks to be generated and displayed correctly.
