# Project Brief: easy-dataset

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to enable the `easy-dataset` application to correctly process PDF files using a local, Dockerized `mineru-api` instance and display the resulting text chunks in the user interface.

## Scope

-   Integrate `easy-dataset` with a local `mineru-api`.
-   Debug and resolve issues preventing text chunks from being displayed.
-   Ensure the file processing pipeline is robust and handles file paths correctly.
-   Remove all debugging artifacts from the code.
-   Document the debugging process and solution.
